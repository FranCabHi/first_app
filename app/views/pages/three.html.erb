Sit in window and stare oooh, a bird, yum love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) for taco cat backwards spells taco cat or stare at ceiling light, but it's 3am, time to create some chaos and who's the baby. Cats are a queer kind of folk meowing non stop for food for attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim cough furball and do not try to mix old food with new one to fool me! sleeps on my head. Sleep on keyboard flop over, for stare at guinea pigs so sleep on keyboard, or sit by the fire or weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed but grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish. Your pillow is now my pet bed intrigued by the shower swat at dog, yet friends are not food. Skid on floor, crash into wall chase laser no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out cat fur is the new black or eat half my food and ask for more.</p>
